1.Given a side of square. Find its perimeter and area.
a = float(input("Kvadratning tomonini kiriting: "))
perimetr = 4 * a
yuza = a ** 2
2.Given diameter of circle. Find its length.
import math
# Given diameter
diameter = 5  # you can change this to any value
# Calculate circumference
circumference = math.pi * diameter
# Print the result
print(f"The circumference of the circle is: {circumference:.2f}")
3.Given two numbers a and b. Find their mean.
# Given numbers
a = 7
b = 13
# Calculate mean
mean = (a + b) / 2
# Print the result
print(f"The mean of {a} and {b} is: {mean}")
4.Given two numbers a and b. Find their sum, product and square of each number.
# Given numbers
a = 5
b = 3
# Calculations
sum_ab = a + b
product_ab = a * b
square_a = a ** 2
square_b = b ** 2
# Output the results
print(f"Sum of {a} and {b}: {sum_ab}")
print(f"Product of {a} and {b}: {product_ab}")
print(f"Square of {a}: {square_a}")
print(f"Square of {b}: {square_b}")
